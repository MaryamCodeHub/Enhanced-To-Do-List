# Task Management System
Project Overview
The Task Management System is a Python application designed to help users effectively manage their tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to add, view, filter, sort, and mark tasks as completed, making it easier to stay organized and productive.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can create new tasks with descriptions.
View Tasks: Displays all tasks along with their current statuses (completed or incomplete).
Filter Tasks: Allows users to filter tasks based on their completion status.
Sort Tasks: Users can sort tasks by different criteria, including task ID, description, or status.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can easily mark tasks as completed by entering the task ID or part of the task description.

Data Structure
The tasks are stored in a list of dictionaries, where each task is represented by a dictionary containing the following keys:
id: A unique identifier for the task.
description: A brief description of the task.
status: The current status of the task (e.g., "incomplete" or "completed").

Sample Workflow
Users start by adding new tasks to the system, providing a brief description for each task.
Users can view all tasks to see their current status.
Users can filter the tasks to display only completed or incomplete tasks.
Users can sort the tasks by various criteria to organize their list effectively.
Users can mark a task as completed by entering its ID or part of its description.

Purpose
This project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for individuals and teams to manage their tasks, improve productivity, and keep track of their progress. It serves as an educational exercise in Python programming, focusing on basic data manipulation, user input handling, and control flow.
